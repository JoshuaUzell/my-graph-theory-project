In **social networks**, it would be great for checking for common patterns between social network groups since graphs are useful at representing people and their connections. **Chemistry** is another field it could benefit since molecules could be represented by graphs as well which could aid in designing new medical drugs when checking for structural similarities between molecules."

If this increased to (1,2,3), then we will increase the number of arrangements from 2 to 6. The bigger the set, the more arrangements there are.
