    "When it comes to <b>Graph Theory</b> in computer science, there are many cases where problems can occur. One of the main ones to occur is the <b>Graph Isomorphism problem</b>. In this notebook, we'll discuss what <b>Graph Isomorphism</b> is, the problem associated with it and the algorithms that are being used to try and solve it in an efficient manner. This will be followed by a conclusion section going over what has been learned."

    "**Graph Isomorphism** is a comparison between two graphs to see if they both look exactly the same structurally. In a description written by Royle from Wolfram MathWorld, he says that **“Two graphs which contain the same number of graph vertices connected in the same way are said to be isomorphic.”**(Royle, no date) which means they have the same structure. If we put two graphs beside eachother and we can see that it’s possible to have a 1 to 1 or bijective mapping between both of their vertices, and the structure and the number of vertices and edges are the same in both graphs, then they are said to be isomorphic.
